# This file is for the backup-script to run and take instructions from this file to process.
# The file layout is as the following

# BACKUP-TYPE, NAME, LOCATION
# BACKUP-TYPE can be of the following options {FILE, DIR, CMD}

# Also you can input BACKUP-STORE-DIR as a custom string to be replaced with the auto generated backup-store-dir then you can add
# your file name after like so mysqldump --all-databases > BACKUP-STORE-DIR/output.sql

# For the CMD backup-type you can also add a 4th value to redirect stdErr and stdOut to a file to put in the log file if
# system doesn't return 0 (meaning success).
# only say YES to this option only if your current script doesn't already outputting the stream to a file.

# Keyword for name is COMPRESS-CONTENTS if this is successfull it will automatically remove the contents as the archive exists.

# Example
# CMD, MYPROCESS, ping google.com -c 4, YES - this redirects the ping output to the log file.


# Example
# FILE, myFileName, /home/jnormington/Desktop/file.txt
