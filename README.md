Basic perl backup script

Back in the day when experimenting with web applications, I created a basic perl script which ran as part of a nightly cron job and;

compressed certain files/directories
utilised mysqldump utilty
sftp to upload to an external resource
It uses a backup conf file which reads and completes the actions the user has requested.

Has the ability to put any command as the backup.conf examples.
